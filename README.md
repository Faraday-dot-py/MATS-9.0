# MATS-9.0
This repo contains my application for Neel Nanda's MATS 9.0 Stream. 

### Goals for this project:
- [ ] Learn something new.
	- I've found it quite difficult to make progress on my knowledge of mechanistic interpretability, as I tend to be more of a hands-on learner and haven't gotten my hands properly dirty yet. This project is a great excuse to do that!
	- Deliverable: Learn a fundamental concept of mech interp well enough to explain it to my mom, and for her to understand it.
- [ ] Come up with an idea I'm excited about
	- Q: Why work on a project if I'm not excited about it? A: Excitement is that *special sauce* that turns "welp, back to work" into realizing the solution to a problem while you're doing something completely different.
	- Deliverable: Either answer my original question (and come up with follow-up questions), or get to a point where I can't move further without help.
- [ ] Get accepted to MATS 9.0
	- MATS provides an incredible opportunity to skip the bureaucratic nonsense involved with interning at some large companies, and instead connects you directly with right and proper AI researchers. This experience is invaluable and would drastically improve my research and communication skills, something I've been working on for a while.
	- Deliverable: Secure a 12-week research internship with Neel Nanda!
