| ~1 hr   | Set up repo, established structure for project, wrote down first idea                                                                                                      | Took a break to head to class, ~1 hr of working time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2.5 hrs | Download model and Shakespeare ds, and run basic activations on a string                                                                                                   | ChatGPT is amazing for defining terms and deep research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2.5 hrs | Finish the initial script, some interesting finds with the activations for a sample of the DS, build training script                                                       | Seeing the activation graph is very promising, hoping that my ideas are correct                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1.5 hrs | Found a dataset to work with, started cleaning and formatting. Started work on some other validation functions to help with scoring and figuring out if the network works. | Finding a large good dataset is not easy!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3 hrs   | DS cleaning and formatting done! Ran a first pass over the network with the Shakespeare DS                                                                                 | Processing the DS takes forever, even with multiple workers per file. <br>I may need to modify the program to process multiple files in parallel. DS topic diversity looks good! <br>Shakespeare DS reveals some issues with the L1 score, going to try a proper DS before tuning hyperparameters |
| 1.5 hrs | Started tuning the model on the DS, and switched to Google's Gemma 3 270m it (Gemma 4b wouldn't load in a colab notebook).                                                 | Seem to have found a good baseline for hyperparameters, next step is to spend some time steering the model. I'd also like to try expanding the model's dimensions and significantly lowering the topk dimensions                                                                                  |
| 2 hrs   | Enabled more data access to the SAE, re-tuned some hyperparams, set up github and google drive storage for DS                                                              | More data means more tuning, hoping to have all the data before locking in the hyperparameters and finishing this project. It's been an amazing learning experience so far, and I need to start documenting more of my projects like this!                                                        |
| 2 hrs   | Worked toward tuning the model to account for a larger dataset, cleaned up the code a bit                                                                                  | The model needed to be re-tuned when I increased the training samples to 2500 from 1000. It also helped the model generalize a bit more. Noticing that the DS is too biased toward sports and not enough other stuff. Wonder if there are any training techniques to help with this?              |
