| ~1 hr   | Set up repo, established structure for project, wrote down first idea                                                                                                      | Took a break to head to class, ~1 hr of working time                            |
| 2.5 hrs | Download model and Shakespeare ds, and run basic activations on a string                                                                                                   | ChatGPT is amazing for defining terms and deep research                         |
| 2.5 hrs | Finish the initial script, some interesting finds with the activations for a sample of the DS, build training script                                                       | Seeing the activation graph is very promising, hoping that my ideas are correct |
| 1.5 hrs | Found a dataset to work with, started cleaning and formatting. Started work on some other validation functions to help with scoring and figuring out if the network works. | Finding a large good dataset is not easy!                                       |
