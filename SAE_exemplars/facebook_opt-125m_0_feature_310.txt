Wildlife sanctuaries play a crucial role in preserving biodiversity and represent significant ecotourism potential, making them prominent sites for effective management and conservation efforts. These sanctuaries provide a habitat for a majority of the remaining flora and fauna species, particularly mammalian herbivores. However, human activities are causing increasing degradation of wildlife sanctuaries. Anthropogenic activities like game exploitation, logging, farming, and urbanization in the vicinity of protected areas pose significant challenges to wildlife conservation, particularly in West Africa. Consequently, numerous species have become rare, and their population numbers and habitats have seen significant declines in the past century. Human activities, both legal and illegal, can lead to the extinction of fauna species, particularly mammalian herbivores, and the loss of herbivores can disrupt ecosystems, often negatively affecting other species and ecosystem services. Both the environment and anthropogenic effects pose threats to the populations of large and small mammals. Human activities, especially illegal ones, have disrupted the ecological balance in protected areas, affecting various fauna species within these ecosystems. This disruption has significantly increased the rate of mammal extinction, impacting more than one-fifth of all global mammal species. Despite their important ecosystem services, fauna species continue to be endangered by human-induced activities. Habitat destruction and degradation stand out as major factors contributing to the extinction and decline of mammalian herbivores. Mammalian herbivores encompass mammals of various body sizes, both small and large, adapted to consuming plant materials and playing a fundamental role in rangeland dynamics. They are categorized into grazers, primarily feeding on grasses and forbs, and browsers, primarily feeding on woody vegetation. These herbivores inhabit diverse terrestrial ecosystems across the globe.

The second match against Chapel Floorball Club from Glenrothes ended in an undeserved 4-1 defeat after a good game with plenty of goal opportunities on both sides. A further defeat against Bath meant that Aberdeen Oilers ended up 3rd in their group. The relatively good goal difference however allowed the team to progress to the quarter-finals of the tournament where they played later finalists Brighton Rock. The match ended 4-1 in favour of Brighton. To determine the final placing of teams, a further round saw the first clash between Dundee Northern Lights and the Oilers, a game which proved to be one of the closest fought in the whole tournament. Regular time could not split the two sides after the Oilers scored an equaliser in the dying seconds of the game. The penalty shoot-out ended in sudden death after 7th rounds with the more experienced Dundee side finally winning the game. Aberdeen ended up 8th overall.
